 * Url where the collection resides, for example http://localhost:8080/rest/customers
 * 
 * UpdateMicroflow:
 * will be triggered when a change is received. Should have one input argument which is a transient object, in which the json data will be parsed
 * 
 * DeleteMicroflow:
 * will be triggered when a delete is received. Input argument is the key of the object to be deleted, as string
 * 
 * 
 * Timeout:
 * 
 * timeout of individual in seconds (longer is more efficient, but might cause firewall issues). 0 for unlimited. negative for timeout or return on the first change. Default value should be -50.
